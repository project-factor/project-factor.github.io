We take in your query and compare it to open source databases that are available to us to provide you with relevant results.
We only display articles from websites that are non-for-profit, and thus relatively unbiased.
We implemet javascript APIs to catalog the search query and then feed it through our HTML structure and CSS script.
On the side of every link we provide is also a button to cite the article in MLA format and copy it into your clipboard.

PURPOSE
To provide a quick engine to search on so you won't have to waste time looking for articles and citing them.
